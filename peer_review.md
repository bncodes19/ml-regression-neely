Link to repository for review: <https://github.com/drodmay1/ml_regression_davidrm/blob/main/regression_davidrm.ipynb>

- Clarity & Organization: David's notebook was clear and easy to follow. There is a concise introduction at the top as well as section headings and imports. The visualizations used a consistent pattern and color scheme which was also easy to view.
- Feature Selection & Justification: We chose the same dataset, however David used all the features available for feature selection. He explains why he chose all of them since they are all relevant to the outcome.
- Model Performance & Comparisons: Performance is evaluated in Section 4 and David notes the model wasn't perfect but made good predictions. His explanation makes complete sense given the (sometimes) unpredictability of insurance charges.
- Reflection Quality: Reflections are all neatly organized and concise after each section. The final summarzation includes the necessary sections including findings and challenges.
